Persona:
To fight the Shadows, each SEES member can summon a Persona, a manifestation of a person's inner self. The most iconic feature is how the members of SEES release their Personas: by firing a gun-like object called an Evoker(Fake Gun) at their head. They shoot themselves in order to instill fear into themselves and make it seem like a situation in which their lives are immediately in danger. Doing these actions allow them to summon their Personas with ease.

Kirijo Group:
The Kirijo Group's discovery of the Shadows' existence and subsequent experiments on manipulating them, ostensibly as a power source and means of time manipulation, resulted in a catastrophic accident at their laboratories, killing hundreds and resulting in creation of the Dark Hour.

Dark Hour:
A hidden twenty-fifth hour that takes place every midnight, during which the world comes to a stop and humans reflexively contain themselves in coffins, obliviously "playing dead" to protect themselves from the attention of the Shadows. Occasionally, a human will not transmogrify in this manner, and will quickly become prey of the Shadows, having their minds devoured and becoming vegetative (Apathy Syndrome) and in some cases even become a shadow as their physical form dissolves, reducing themself to being a shadow. Only those with Personas, even if they can't be successfully summoned, are immune to this effect and function normally during the Dark Hour.Shadows are existences of pure thought and energy and do not possess physical bodies, and thus cannot interact with normal space. They do, however, possess the ability to manipulate space-time and use this ability to create the Dark Hour, a space existing outside of normal space-time where they can move freely. "Transmogrification" is merely an identifier of someone who does not exist within the Dark Hour, and thus cannot be affected by those within it. As for those with the "Potential", who can move freely within the Dark Hour, they are people who are able to use the shadows' space-time manipulation ability for themselves.

Social Links:
An in-game mechanic that expands around the idea of the 'strength of your bond' with any one person. It starts of at 0 being strangers 1 being freinds on the barest level with a max 10 being either the closest of freinds/brothers/lovers. Social Link rank goes up after a meaningfull event between 2 people. The characters will behave in a manner respecting the level of the social link between 2 people. 

World History:
Set in the retalively normal looking world to the plain eye in the year 2009 in Japan. There exists Persona's and Shadows in this world. 

Future Story:
The Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad is formed to combat these enemies. Once they're defeated, a thirteenth Shadow of the Death arcana appears as an ordinary, carefree teenage boy calling himself Ryoji Mochizuki. However, it's his role to call down Nyx, a being who will exterminate all life in response to humanity's self-destructive desires, but his human side is wracked with guilt over this unavoidable fate.

The Fall:
The Old Documents say that the Shadows arise from human emotions. When enough of the Shadows were gathered in one place, they fused together and created Nyx Avatar, which set in motion the events which were to lead up to the The Fall. Aigis delayed the Fall by fracturing Death into the 12 Arcana.

Tartarus:
The bulk of the Shadows dwell in Tartarus, a massive tower that appears during the Dark Hour, right atop Gekkoukan High School, the site of the previous accident. Each Shadow is defined by two characteristics: the body and the mask. The mask represents the Arcana of the Shadow, while the body helps define its name. These two attributes also aid as a visual reminder of an enemy's weaknesses and strengths.

Full Moon:
Each full moon after the Main Character's arrival, powerful Shadows belonging to the first twelve major arcana appear outside Tartarus and threaten to wreak havoc.

BackStory:
Due to an incident 10 years ago in 1999 which resulted in the death of the parents Minato Ariasto (the protagonist) and the sealing of 'Death' into him by Aegis.

Shadow Arcana:
These special Shadows are the fragments of Death that escaped following the sealing of Thanatos into the protagonist. They appear at every full moon, seeking to return to Death which is sealed into the protagonist.

Shadow Arcana's:
Arcana Magician,Arcana Priestess,Arcana Empress,Arcana Emperor,Arcana Hierophant,Arcana Lovers,Arcana Chariot,Arcana Justice,Arcana Hermit,Arcana Fortune,Arcana Strength,Arcana Hanged Man

The Fall:
Just as the Arcana represent the psychological maturity of humans, they also represent the tendencies and psychological complexes of Shadows. No single Arcana's worth of shadows can result in the reformation of Nyx's psyche, but when powerful shadows of Arcanas 0-12 fuse, the resultant shadow can mutate into the 13th Arcana, Death, which is capable of carrying the true weight of Nyx's consciousness and power and signifies that the preparations for Nyx's revival have been completed. Once completed, it merely calls for its body in order to return to a whole being, which is otherwise known as "The Fall". Tartarus acts as an antenna for this, calling more shadows to it and growing taller with the more shadows calling from within it

Pre-Story:
During a full moon, one of the Shadows attacks, causing Minato to awaken his initial Persona, Orpheus. The summoning sequence, however, was halted as Thanatos bursts forth from Orpheus' head, tearing apart Orpheus and slaying the Shadows. After dispatching the remaining Shadows, Minato fainted and was taken to the Hospital. While unconscious, he awakens in the Velvet Room, where he learns about his abilities. Minato later learns about the nature of the Shadows and the existence of SEES, and eventually joins SEES. Out of all characters to appear in Persona 3, Minato is the only character with access to the Wild Card ability. He goes to school on first day with Yukari Takeba leading to rumors about them.

Velvet Room:
The Velvet Room often manifests itself differently in the world, but it is always covered in blue velvet and hosted by Igor. The purpose of the Velvet Room is always to manage Personas and use them in fusion. The room is invisible to all except those with high spiritual sensitivity. In Persona 3, Igor states that only those who have formed a contract can be guests.The Velvet Room (ベルベット・ルーム, Berubetto Ruumu)? is a room located between consciousness and subconsciousness
