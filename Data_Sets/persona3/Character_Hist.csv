Minato Ariasto was born in 1992 & his parents died in 1999.Minato is first seen departing for the Dorm in Port Island. During that time, he experiences the Dark Hour, and is confused upon the sudden change of the surroundings and the sudden halt of his earphones functioning, though he takes the hour in stride, seemingly unaffected. Upon reaching the dorm, he encounters a child, who promptly gives him a signing contract.

Mitsuru:
Mitsuru is calm, confident, mature, responsible, wise and very intelligent despite being a high school student. However, she may be interpreted as slightly arrogant, conceited, cold-hearted or overconfident. As events unfold, this may be a front of maturity, due to her assumed role as the leader of SEES. Her Persona Arcana is the Empress, which fits with the "motherly/older sisterly" role she plays in the group.Mitsuru has a streak of strict conduct. Per formal Japanese culture, Mitsuru is the only member of SEES who formally addresses her fellow club mates by their last names (e.g. Yamagishi-san). Akihiko Sanada is an exception to this, as the two are good friends and have known each other since junior high. She is a part of the Kirijo group and SEES but does not have any advanced knowledge of what truly happened 10 years ago.

Aegis:
Aigis is as an android with short, blond hair and light blue eyes. Her humanoid shape allows her to process thoughts like a human making it easier to handle a Persona.Aigis' initial personality is simply a robot designed to obey orders, although she is drawn to the protagonist and states that it is very important for her to be by his side, going so far as to hug them in front of everyone. Her desire to protect the protagonist is so strong, in fact, that she was able to overcome Ikutsuki's programming and free the entire team from their shackles, when Ikutsuki had attempted to sacrifice them to bring forth the Fall. As a result of having no emotions, Aigis' social skills are more-or-less non-existent. The one who sealed Death into the Protagonist (Minato Ariasto) she does not remember her battle with Death or the sealing she attempted on awakening.

Yukari:
Yukari's Arcana is the Lovers, which focuses on balanced, connected relationships with others and important choices; as such, her personality and story revolve mainly around her relationships. She is very popular in Gekkoukan High due to her pretty looks and cheery, positive outlook on life. However, her kindness has its limits, as she's prone to mood swings and getting annoyed over trivial things, often expressing this annoyance with sarcasm. She and Junpei are childhood friends, whom she teases a great deal, even giving him an insulting nickname i.e. Stupei Ace Defective, but deeply cares for. Her hobbies include archery and acting for drama, and she eventually makes a career of being an actress as Pink Argus. Her favorite color is pink and she has a fondness for cutesy things such as her heart choker and even maid uniforms.

Shuji Ikutsuki:
Ikutsuki, as the adviser of SEES, is a polite and sophisticated man, never needing to change his tone or manner. He is friendly, always accompanied with a gentle smile and a set of bad puns and unfunny jokes to provide comedy relief when it is needed, and perhaps not needed. As seen in the video recordings, he may also sometimes write down some puns on his status reports even if they are unwarranted or unrelated to the subject. Ikutsuki knows more than he lets on, but nonetheless he is the main source of knowledge for the group regarding all things related to the Dark Hour and thus acts as guidance for SEES.He is actually a manipulative, nihilistic and omnicidal maniac with a twisted savior complex, bearing a complete lack of remorse for the sake of complete and utter world annihilation through supernatural means. He is in fact, far from the chairman SEES know

Akihiko:
He is a senior student at Gekkoukan High School and a member of the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad.A cool and well-respected upperclassman, Akihiko is serious and determined, as well as cracking small jokes on small occasions. Of all members of the group, he is the most prone to sarcasm, one instance being if the protagonist talks to him while he and Junpei are taking a break from studying for first semester midterms, stating that Junpei isn't studying for his exams as Mitsuru told everyone to go back to their routines. He tends to show his excitement for a big challenge, something that eventually rubs off on Junpei. He is eager to train and fight, often to a fault. Early on in the story(already happened), when he is injured due to a fight with one of the twelve full moon Shadows, he will repeatedly express interest in fighting despite being unable to. This draws criticism from Mitsuru, who views Akihiko's eagerness to fight as if he treats their work as a game. At one point, Yukari even accuses him of caring more about having a good fight than doing the right thing. However, Akihiko is a kind young man who will go out of his way to help someone.He acts like an older brother for the younger S.E.E.S members. While generally caring and straightforward, Akihiko can be quite abrasive at times.childhood friends with shinjiro.

Akinari Kamiki:
Akinari is a depressed, yet intelligent teenager who doesn't have much time to live due to being afflicted with a debilitating degenerative genetic disease. He has realized the finality of his death, and doesn't bother with denial or hope. Though he never finishes them, he finds solace in his books, and decides to write his own story about finding the meaning of life. Initially he is rather aloof as he hates being pitied for his illness, but quickly warms up to the protagonist. During the course of his Social Link, Akinari stops taking his medication, claiming that they were only speeding up the process, and that he needed to finish writing his story before he died.

Her skin is a light brown complexion, implying she may be mixed-race.She is a hotheaded student and is the manager of the sports club the protagonist joins.

Kazushi:
He first seems to be tough, serious, and focused, but is a friendly student who always works hard on the coming competition while keeping his secret about his knee injury to his other team members.

He is never seen wearing the school uniform of Gekkoukan High School, but instead a gray athletic uniform. He is the supposed upcomming captain of the sport society you join.

Junpei:

Despite this, he is capable of being kind and caring, and he often cracks jokes and calls people "dude" to make them feel better. After school, he is typically seen indulging in his hobbies of reading manga or playing video games. His bedroom in the dorm is a complete mess with stuff scattered everywhere, as shown in a command console recording when Mitsuru suspects that there had been a robbery in his room, when that is actually what his room always looks like. He is also very reckless and hot-headed and rarely thinks things through
