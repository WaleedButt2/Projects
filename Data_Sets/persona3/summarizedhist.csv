SEES members fight Shadows using Personas, manifestations of their inner selves, which are summoned using Evokers. The Kirijo Group accidentally created the Dark Hour, a hidden 25th hour during which Shadows roam and most humans are protected in coffin-like states. Those with Personas are immune and can move freely during the Dark Hour. Social Links represent the strength of bonds between people and affect character behavior. The world is set in Japan in 2009, where Shadows and Personas exist. Tartarus, a massive tower appearing during the Dark Hour, houses most Shadows, and powerful Shadows appear each full moon. The protagonist, Minato Ariasto, lost his parents in a 1999 incident and unknowingly sealed the entity 'Death' within himself. Minato awakens his initial Persona, Orpheus, which is destroyed by Thanatos. He then learns about his abilities, the Shadows, and SEES before joining the group. Minato is the only character with the Wild Card ability and attends school with Yukari Takeba, sparking rumors about their relationship.
