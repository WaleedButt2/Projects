352,"You to Susan: You know, Susan, sometimes I wonder what Dutch sees in you. ",Susan: Why don't you ask him? You: Maybe I will. Maybe I'll ask him if he enjoys being with someone so desperate for his attention.
353,"You to Susan: Susan, it's pretty obvious that you're just a means to an end for Dutch. ","Susan: And what end is that? You: I don't know, maybe just to have someone around who will do whatever he says without question."

359,"You to Susan: Susan, can you believe how terrible the food is here? ",Susan: It's not that bad. You: That's because you have no taste. I'm surprised you can even taste anything with that sour expression on your face all the time.
